# logReffererTS
A script that takes a server log as an input and spits out a plot of the main referrers

The script was used to make the graphic on http://amitkohli.com/?p=345 ... your log file might be a different format or have an error after some number of lines (in which case don't read the whole script, read only until the line before the error).

Also make sure to check which are your main referrers first, and then change the script accordingly, they might not be the same as mine.
